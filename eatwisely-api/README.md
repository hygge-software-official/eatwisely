## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure with the following main components:

- `index.js`: The main entry point of the application
- `routes/`: Contains all the route handlers for different API endpoints
- `utils/`: Utility functions and configurations
- `lib/`: Additional libraries and services

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file (see Configuration section)

## Configuration

Ð¡onfiguration can be found in `serverless.yml` and `utils/config.js`.
